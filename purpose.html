                    There was a time when I believed that success was only about reaching a destination — a degree, a
                    job title, or a stable position. Over time, I realized that growth is not defined by where you
                    stand, but by how consistently you move forward, even when the path is unclear.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-primary); margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    Coming from an engineering background and transitioning into international business and technology,
                    I often found myself standing between two worlds. One demanded precision, logic, and systems. The
                    other required adaptability, strategy, and human understanding. Instead of choosing one, I decided
                    to learn from both.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-primary); margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    This website exists because learning should not stay hidden inside notebooks or folders. Every
                    project, research paper, and technical experiment represents hours of curiosity, confusion, and
                    persistence. Some ideas worked, many failed, but every attempt added clarity.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-primary); margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    Motivation, for me, is not a sudden burst of energy. It is the quiet discipline of showing up —
                    studying when results are uncertain, building when recognition is absent, and improving when no one
                    is watching. Progress often feels invisible, but consistency always leaves a trace.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-primary); margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    I believe that technology and business are not just tools for efficiency, but platforms for impact.
                    Automation should reduce human struggle, data should guide better decisions, and innovation should
                    serve real problems. Whether it is an embedded system project, a research study, or a data analysis
                    dashboard, my goal remains the same: to create solutions that matter.
                </p>

                    This blog is a small reflection of that journey. Not a declaration of mastery, but a reminder that
                    growth is ongoing. If you are reading this while questioning your own path, remember this — clarity
                    comes after action, not before it.
                </p>
