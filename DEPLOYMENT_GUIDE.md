Follow these steps to publish your portfolio website.

## 1. Create a GitHub Account

- Verify your email address.

## 2. Create a Repository
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Click the **+** (top right) -> **New repository**.
3. **Repository Name**: `snekanthbabu.github.io`
   *Important*: It must look exactly like this (yourusername.github.io).
4. Select **Public**.
5. Click **Create repository**.

## 3. Upload Files
1. In your new repository, click **uploading an existing file**.
2. Drag and drop ALL files from your local `portfolio` folder.
   - Includes: `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `assets/`, `games/`, etc.
3. Wait for the upload to complete.
4. Scroll down, type "Initial commit" in the message box.
5. Click **Commit changes**.

## 4. Enable GitHub Pages & Verify
1. Your site usually goes live automatically with this repository name.
2. Go to `https://snekanthbabu.github.io`
3. If it doesn't appear after 5 minutes:
   - Go to **Settings** -> **Pages**.
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch" -> "main" or "master" -> "/ (root)".
   - Click **Save**.

## 5. Updating Content
- **Text Changes**: Edit the `.html` files (e.g., `experience.html`) using any text editor, save, and re-upload/commit to GitHub.
- **New Images**: Add them to `assets/images` and push/upload.

## 6. Links
- Remember to update placeholder links in `contact.html` with your actual GitHub and LinkedIn URLs once your profiles are ready.
